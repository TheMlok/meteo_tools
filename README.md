# meteo_tools

A crate for counting and converting meteorological units.


This crate can convert and count meteorological values from measurements. Like conversion from C to F and vice versa. Counting
dew point, heat index, humidex, mixing ratio, absolute relative_humidity, etc. See the docs for all functionality.


I created this crate for my API to personal meteo project to count values from measured data sent from Raspberry PIs and Arduinos.# meteo_tools
